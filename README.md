# Double Pendulum Simulation with Ceiling Collisions (Julia + GLMakie)

This is a Julia project that simulates a **double pendulum** with additional mechanics for **collision with the ceiling**. The simulation is interactive and allows for user-defined initial conditions, pendulum parameters, and force application via GUI built using **GLMakie**.

## Features

- Real-time simulation of a double pendulum
- Visual interface with sliders and inputs
- Interactive force application to masses
- Elastic collision detection with the ceiling
- Deformation of rods based on tension forces (using Young's modulus)

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Julia installed: https://julialang.org/downloads/
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kluge1702/double-pendulum-julia.git
   cd double-pendulum-julia
